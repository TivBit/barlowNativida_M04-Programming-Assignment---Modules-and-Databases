This is the SDEV 220 Spring Module 4 Programming Assignment about Modules and Databases

This repository is the Module 04 Programming assignment for SDEV 220 Spring, by T.Barlow | Professor C. Francis.  The zoo.py for chapter 11's task is to create a program that will display the daily hours of the zoo.  The rest of the files are for the Books Assignment.  Please see the bug report below.

Bug Report:
The Zoo program seems to be working with no issues.  HOWEVER, the Books project seems to continue return an error in the console saying that the flask module can't be found.  I installed flask in the Windows Powershell Console and it said that the install was successful.  I have tried to run in the live and virtual environment, with no success.  I will be meeting with my instructor tomorrow to see if I can find my error.  Feedback is appreciated. Programming Student: T.Barlow | Professor: C. Francis
